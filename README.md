Write your resume in
[Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikepqr/resume.md/main/resume.md),
style it with [CSS](resume.css), output to [HTML](resume.html) and
[PDF](resume.pdf).

Note: This is version has been redone in Ruby simply because I wanted a way to do live development of my resume

## Prerequisites

- Ruby â‰¥ 3.0
- [kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown) (`gem install
kramdown`)
- Optional, required for PDF output: Google Chrome or Chromium

## Usage

1. Download [resume.py](resume.py), [resume.md](resume.md) and
   [resume.css](resume.css) (or make a copy of this repository by [using the
   template](https://github.com/mikepqr/resume.md/generate), forking, or
   cloning).

2. Edit [resume.md](resume.md) (the placeholder text is taken with thanks from
   the [JSON Resume Project](https://jsonresume.org/themes/))

3. Run `ruby resume.rb` to build resume.html and resume.pdf.

   - Use `--no-html` or `--no-pdf` to disable HTML or PDF output.

   - Use `--chrome-path=/path/to/chrome` if resume.py cannot find your Chrome
     or Chromium executable.

4. (Optional) Run `gem install rerun` to allow live reloading of html

   - Use `rerun` to launch the gem which will watch any changes to markdown or CSS

## Customization

Edit [resume.css](resume.css) to change the appearance of your resume. The
default style is extremely generic, which is perhaps what you want in a resume,
but CSS gives you a lot of flexibility. See, e.g. [The Tech Resume
Inside-Out](https://www.thetechinterview.com/) for good advice about what a
resume should look like (and what it should say).

Change the appearance of the PDF version (without affecting the HTML version) by
adding rules under the `@media print` CSS selector.

Change the margins and paper size of the PDF version by editing the [`@page` CSS
rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%40page/size).

[python-markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) is by default a very basic
markdown compiler, but it has a number of optional extensions that you may want
to enable (by adding to [the list of extensions
here](https://github.com/mikepqr/resume.md/blob/f1b0699a9b66833cb67bb59111f45a09ed3c0f7e/resume.py#L112)).

in particular may by useful if you are editing the CSS.
